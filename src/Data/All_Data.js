    name: "Akcent",
    info: `Akcent  is a multi-certified, award-winning Romanian dance pop act whose members sing in Romanian, English, Polish and Spanish. Their name originated as a wordplay on accent, although it is pronounced like the English word, ascent, without the velar consonant /k/. The group was created by Adrian S√ÆnƒÉ, and Ramona Barta. Their first single "Nu-mi pasƒÉ de nimeni" ("I don't care about anyone") received positive reactions from critics and became the reason Catalin Muraru signed them to Roton in 1999. They released their debut album Senzatzia in 2000. Except for the first track, "Ultima vara", which received some airplay, the album was a commercial failure and the band disbanded. Soon after, S√ÆnƒÉ brought Marius Nedelcu, Mihai Gruia and Sorin Brotnei into the group, changing it from a duo to a boyband. They came to prominence once with the release of their hit single "Ti-am promis".`,
